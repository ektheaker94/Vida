Running Vida in NodeBox

This is purely experimental at this point. The goal is to allow Vida to run within the NodeBox environment so one could see "real time" graphics of the simulation. As of this writing (2008.07.14) Vida seems to work correctly within NodeBox with two exceptions:
	1.) ASCII progress bars do not work. This is because NodeBox comes with a sys module that differs from the standard sys in that there is no stdout.flush(). There is code in place in Vida that checks to see if Vida is running in NodeBox and, if true, disables all ascii progress bars, regardless of settings.
	2.) There's a cryptic error associated with outputing graphics, but is inconsistant and seems related to previous syntax errors. It only shows up if you throw an error, fix it, and then rerun things. To fix things, quit NodeBox, relaunch and run Vida again
	3.) Simulation states can not be saved to disk. The pickling of the garden simply fails. I've thrown in code to disable archival activities while running in NodeBox. It's not immediately clear to me why it is failing, but here is the traceback:
