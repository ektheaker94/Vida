Description: "The following is a yml file composed for automated parsing, but is human readable. The key values correspond to the column headers found in individual cycle output csv files and the merged csv files produced by Vida."

Cycle #: "Integer. The cycle number of the simulation (which is analogous to year)"
Plant Name: "Alphanumeric. The unique name of an individual object(seed or plant). Assigned by the software."
Species: "Alphanumeric. The name of a given object's(seed or plant) species. The species name is defined in the species file yml under 'nameSpecies'. See 'SpeciesFileHelpData.yml' for more info."
Mother Plant name: "Alphanumeric. The unique name of given object's(seed or plant) mother. Assigned by the software."
X Location: "Float. Location of the individual object(seed or plant) in the simulation space along the X axis."
Y Location: "Float. Location of the individual object(seed or plant) in the simulation space along the Y axis."
is a seed: "Boolean. Is the object a seed or a plant."
is mature: "Boolean. Is the plant object mature enough to reproduce."
Age at Maturity: "Integer. The age(in years) at which the plant object is first able to reproduce."
cycles until germination: "Integer. Number of cycles remaining until the seed object can germinate. Species can be configured to have a delay in germination in the species file yml under 'delayInGermination'. See 'SpeciesFileHelpData.yml' for more info. "
Age: "Integer. The age(in years) of the individual object in the simulation."

Mass of all Seeds: "Float. The combined mass of all the seed objects currently on the mother plant object, in kg."
Mass Stem+Mass Canopy: "Float. The combined mass of the the aboveground woody parts of a plant object and the photosynthetic parts of a plant object, in kg."
Mass Total: "Float. The combined mass of the the aboveground woody parts of a plant object, the photosynthetic parts of a plant object, and the combined mass of all the seed objects currently on the mother plant object, in kg."
Diameter Stem: "Float. The diameter of the object (seed or plant), in meters."
Radius Canopy: "Float. The diameter of the plant object, in meters."
Area covered: "Float. The area of the projected area of the photosynthetic surface of plant objects which is 100% shaded by overtopping plant objects, in square meters."
Height Stem: "Float. The height of the plant object's aboveground woody parts, in meters."
Maximum Thickness of a Leaf: "Float. The thinckness of the plant object's photosynthetic surface, in meters. The thickness is defined in the species file yml under 'heightLeafMax'. See 'SpeciesFileHelpData.yml' for more info."

Yearly Growth Stem diameter (m): "Float. The growth of a plant object's aboveground woody part's diameter for the given cycle(year), in meters."
Yearly Growth Stem Height (m): "Float. The growth of a plant object's aboveground woody part's height for the given cycle(year), in meters."
Average Growth Stem (kg): "Float. The average growth of a plant object's aboveground woody parts over the lifetime of the object, in kg."
Average Growth Canopy (kg): "Float. The average growth of a plant object's photosynthetic parts over the lifetime of the object, in kg."
